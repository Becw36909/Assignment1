<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<p><h2>Overview</h2></p>

<p>The project will be to craft a pair of equestrian sport spurs that have small touch sensors installed in the tips with the ability to measure pressure and track the usage rate. The sensors will connect to a smart watch or phone and alert the rider during the training session when a level of pressure or the usage rate has been exceeded. It will also keep the history and track the trends of the rider’s use of the spur over time. </p>

<p><h2>Motivation</h2></p>

<p>My main motivation for this project is to enhance the standards of welfare for horses ridden and utilised for horse sports. Spurs can be a helpful tool to give the rider refined aids and subtlety when training in the competition arena, however there can also be serious downsides to incorrect spur use. Excessive and use of spurs can cause physical pain through continues abrasive or ‘jabbing’ action from the rider and break the skin of the horse to the tissues underneath, as well as significantly contributing to mental stress for the horse.</p>

<p>This project idea is primarily geared toward both the pleasure riders and the sport horse industry in Australia, with last years’ EA Annual Report recording 46,523 registered competition licenses for horses, and 22,909 members<sup>1</sup>. This project idea has a long-term global goal. </p>

<p>I want to help assist both casual and serious riders in their training and competition with their horses, when spurs are worn as an artificial aid. The Equestrian Dressage Rules 2021, Section 1.3 - Abuse of the horse (Article 142, FEI General Regulations and EA rules) states that “No person may abuse a horse during an event or at any other time. ‘Abuse’ means an action or omission that causes or is likely to cause pain or unnecessary discomfort to a horse, including without limitation any of the following: (section c) using spurs excessively or persistently”<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p><h2>Description</h2></p>

<p>Equestrian riders are already accustomed to wearing certain equipment when training and competing (see picture). The fitting of spurs over the riding boots is common and considered normal. The spurs will retain the look of traditional spurs already available for horse sport, with a few differences which I envision will be minor to the overall aesthetic. </p>
<img src="beren2.jpg" align=right hspace=30 vspace=30>
<p>The outer shell of the spur will be constructed of hollow carbon fibre to support any equipment that needs to be fitted inside. The tip of the spur will feature both touch and pressure sensors, to record the number of times the horse is touched by the spur and the amount of pressure applied by the rider. The straps will fit and be fixed as per normal with no change. </p>
<p>The hardware will connect via Bluetooth an app downloaded onto the rider’s smart watch or phone to communication information from the spur to the rider. </p>
<p>Riders will put on the spurs, turn them on and open their app to make the connection before mounting the horse for the ride. The rider will need to be carrying the smart device in a pocket or pouch, or wearing the smart watch while they train. This will allow the app to alert the rider with a noise and/or vibrate in real time, on every occasion that a certain pressure threshold is reached, or the amount of times the horse is touched is exceeded in a certain time frame (pre-determined). </p>
<p>When the rider has completed the session, the app will show them a report in graph or pictures to review the data of the spur use during the session. It might also be used in conjunction with an existing app (Equilab or similar) that measures distance, direction and pace of the horse – this would give an accurate overview of what the horse and rider were doing when the spurs were being applied. </p>
<p>The app will keep the data of each training session so the rider can track their usage over time, to help them analyse their spur use and implement better technique, with the goal being to achieve few-to-no alerts during training sessions. Coaches may also be able to connect to the rider’s spurs with their own app during a training session, and use this real-time data to correct and help shape the rider to learn better technique.</p>
<p>Spurs would be charged wirelessly or magnetically. Updates would be downloaded for the app depending on user settings and connections.</p> 

<p><h2>Tools and Technologies</h2></p>

<p>With limited knowledge in the field of (specific) hardware, I am thinking a capacitive sensor will have the capability to measure both the force and count the instances when the spur is applied by the rider to the horse’s side. Further development may reveal a need for two separate sensors needing to be positioned side by side (vertically) as pictured (this picture is a spur with rubber tips, but used to give the idea of how two sensors might be positioned.) The tips of the spur may be silicone or carbon fibre with a touch pad on the end. If one sensor could be used to just fit at the tip of the spur, it would be more discreet. </p>
<img src="spurs1.jpg" align=right hspace=30 vspace=30>
<p>The hardware may require an Arduino type micro-controller kit to be fitted on the hollow inside of the spur to operate the touch sensor pad/s. </p>
<p>The hardware inside the spurs will connect to the smart device via Bluetooth and communicate the data to an app, specifically designed for the product to measure the statistics necessary for feedback to the rider. </p>
<p>A battery will be needed, and a magnetic induction coil might work best to be fitted inside the spur – probably in one of the shafts – to allow for wireless charging. </p>
<p>LED lights on the outside of the spur shaft to indicate charging/charged/on. </p> 

<p><h2>Skills Required</h2></p>

<p>The skills required for the project will span multiple technology platforms. To take this project idea to the next step, a team may need to be formed with a range of different specialised skills, including - </p>
<p>Knowledge for the correct specifications for the touch sensor pads, how Bluetooth works and coding for the hardware inside the spur (an Arduino microcontroller may be a good option) as well as the development of the app for use by the smart devices. I do not think this project idea will require anything ‘new’ to be thought of as far as hardware goes, just the knowledge of how to code it to work in the desired way – this might require myself to learn, or to source someone with these skills that I do not have. </p>
<p>Development of the software application might be outsourced, or ideally a team member with experience in developing the algorithms needed to create this. Personally, I would also love to learn how building apps is done from the start. </p>
<img src="beren.jpg" align=right hspace=30 vspace=30>
<p>A manufacturer will need to be sourced to collaborate with me on the creation of the physically unique spurs, to develop the size and exact thickness of the outer layer of carbon fibre to fit the hardware inside and make the spurs durable and aesthetically appropriate.</p>
<p>Algorithms for ideal and excessive pressure on the horse’s sides, as well as for frequency of use would have to be tested through research on live participants. This would enable the the developers to follow animal welfare standards. This will allow information on the app to be accurate and truthful, allowing users to understand the information transmitting from the spurs. Andrew Mclean is a world-renowned behavioural animal scientist and I would seek his involvement through my connection to his son, to assist in developing the research to determine the bench marks for ideal and ‘acceptable’ pressures and usage of the spur and what is ‘exceeding these limits’. </p>


<p><h2>Outcome</h2></p>
<p>This project idea, using touch sensors to relay information to riders on the smart devices will assist in awareness and education of how riders are using their spurs as training tools. It will highlight whether they need to improve their technique, to care for the mental and physical awareness of their horses. Until the product has been tested and accepted by the governing bodies (Federation Equestrian Internationale, Equestrian Australia), riders will be able to use them privately at home when training alone and with their coach.</p> 

<p>I wish to positively impact the wider equestrian community by providing tool that can be used by every rider, whether they engage in the sport for pleasure or competitively, that will assure they are using the equipment correctly and above all with their horse’s welfare always coming first. I know as a dedicated horse competitor and passionate horse owner, that there are many of us in Australia and around the world that would benefit from this training aid to assist us to become better and more conscious horse riders. </p>
